# VGG16_CAT_VS_DOG_CLASSIFICATION

Dog vs Cat Classification using VGG16
This repository contains a deep learning model that classifies images of dogs and cats using a pre-trained VGG16 model. The model has been fine-tuned to distinguish between images of dogs and cats based on a dataset provided by Kaggle. The project demonstrates how to leverage a powerful pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve image classification problems.

Overview
This project uses the VGG16 model, a popular deep learning architecture known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks. We fine-tune the model by freezing the initial layers and training only the top layers to classify images as either a dog or a cat. This approach leverages transfer learning, which enables the model to perform well even with limited training data.

Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow >= 2.0
Keras
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
scikit-learn
opencv-python (for image preprocessing)
You can install the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing is the Dogs vs. Cats dataset available on Kaggle. You will need to download and extract the dataset before using the model.

Dataset Structure:
train/: Contains images of dogs and cats for training.
test/: Contains images of dogs and cats for testing (optional, if you'd like to evaluate the model).
Once the dataset is downloaded, make sure the images are placed in the correct folders as specified in the project directory.

Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/raghavavelidi/dog-vs-cat-vgg16.git
cd dog-vs-cat-vgg16
Download the Dogs vs Cats dataset from Kaggle and extract the images into the train/ directory.

Install required Python dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Model Training
Data Preprocessing: The images are resized to 224x224 pixels, which is the input size expected by the VGG16 model. The images are also normalized to scale pixel values between 0 and 1.

Fine-tuning VGG16: The pre-trained VGG16 model is loaded without the top fully connected layers. These layers are replaced with a custom classification head, which is trained to distinguish between dogs and cats.

Training: The model is trained on the prepared dataset, and we use data augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, and flip to prevent overfitting.

Saving the Model: After training, the model is saved as dog_vs_cat_model.h5 for future use.

To train the model, run the following command:

bash
Copy
python train.py
This will start the training process. You can modify the number of epochs and batch size as needed.

Model Evaluation
After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset. The accuracy and loss of the model will be printed out. Additionally, a confusion matrix can be visualized to understand the classification results better.

To evaluate the model, run:

bash
Copy
python evaluate.py
Usage
You can use the trained model to classify new images as either a dog or a cat. To classify a single image, run:

bash
Copy
python classify.py --image path_to_image.jpg
Where path_to_image.jpg is the path to the image file you want to classify.

The model will output whether the image contains a dog or a cat.

Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately X% on the test set, which is a good result considering the simplicity of the architecture and the use of transfer learning.

Below is an example of the performance:

Accuracy: X%
Loss: Y%
